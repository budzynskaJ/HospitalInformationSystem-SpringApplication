# HospitalInformationSystem-SpringApplication

An implementation of hospital information system.
The main assumption of this system is to communicate with an opensource repository of medical data,
which is based on the openEHR standard (EHRServer by Pablo Pazos Gutierrez for CaboLabs).
The web application imitates a hospital information system which has one module, an electronic
health record module.
